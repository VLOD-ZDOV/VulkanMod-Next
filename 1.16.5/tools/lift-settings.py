"""Generates the port's settings table from the 1.12.2 mod's own declarations.

A hundred and seven settings, each with a category, a default, a range and a
sentence describing it. Retyping them would be a hundred and seven chances to
get a default wrong, and a wrong default is invisible: the setting simply
behaves differently than the one the player knows from the other version.

So they are lifted, with their words. What cannot be lifted is which of them
actually does anything here — that is a fact about this port, not about the
declarations — so it is carried in a list in this file and printed as part of
each entry.

 * Every setting the mod has, declared once.
 *
 * <h2>Generated, and why</h2>
 *
 * This file is written by {@code tools/lift-settings.py} out of the 1.12.2
 * mod's own declarations — the keys, the categories, the defaults, the ranges
 * and the sentences describing them. Retyping a hundred and seven settings
 * would be a hundred and seven chances to get a default wrong, and a wrong
 * default is the invisible kind of wrong: the setting works, and behaves
 * differently from the one the player already knows.
 *
 * <h2>Declared is not the same as working</h2>
 *
 * Most of these do nothing here yet, because the part of the mod they steer has
 * not been ported. They are listed anyway, and each one says which it is. That
 * is the whole point of showing them: a menu that hides what is missing tells a
 * player the port is further along than it is, and a menu whose switches
 * silently do nothing is worse than one that has none.
