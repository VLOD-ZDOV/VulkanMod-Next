/**
 * Whether a newer build of this mod exists, asked once and never again.
 *
 * <h2>Two places, both asked, and the order still matters</h2>
 *
 * Both are asked every time rather than the second only when the first fails,
 * and that is the difference between two sources and one with a spare. A build
 * can be on one and not yet on the other — published to the repository and not
 * uploaded to the page, or the reverse — and a check that stops at the first
 * answer reports the older of the two as the newest there is.
 *
 * So the highest version either of them names is the answer, and the link is
 * decided separately: it points at CurseForge whenever CurseForge has that
 * version, because a download there is worth something to whoever wrote this,
 * and at the repository's releases when it does not — whether because the file
 * is not up there yet or because the service did not answer at all. Sending
 * somebody to a page that has not got what they were just told about is a
 * worse outcome than losing the click.
 *
 * <h2>What leaves the machine</h2>
 *
 * Exactly what the 1.12.2 build sends, to the same addresses: two GET requests
 * with no query, no body and no identifier of any kind. The only thing said
 * about the caller is a user agent naming this mod and its version, which
 * GitHub refuses a request without. Nothing about the machine, the player, the
 * world or the other mods is collected, sent or logged. The switch that turns
 * this off is {@code updateCheck}, and turning it off means the requests are
 * never made rather than made and discarded.
 *
 * <h2>What differs from the 1.12.2 build: only the reading of the answer</h2>
 *
 * Both builds are one mod on one page and in one repository, but they are
 * numbered separately — this one starts again from 0.1 while the 1.12.2 build
 * is past 0.10. Read the way the 1.12.2 build reads them, both answers would
 * tell every player of this build that the newest 1.12.2 release is an update
 * for them, which it is not and cannot be installed as.
 *
 * So only a file named for 1.16.5 counts, from either service. That includes
 * GitHub, which the 1.12.2 build asks for the release's tag: a tag names the
 * release, not the game, and says nothing about whether it carries a jar for
 * this one. The same answer lists the release's files by name, so the same
 * pattern that reads CurseForge reads it too. Same request, same bytes over
 * the wire; only what is looked for in the reply is narrower.
 *
 * <h2>Why it cannot hurt the game</h2>
 *
 * On a daemon thread with a four second ceiling on each half of each request,
 * started once, never retried. Every failure — no network, a service that has
 * changed its shape, a rate limit, a proxy that answers with a login page — is
 * the same failure: the answer stays unknown, nothing is said, and the game
 * does not learn about it. There is no state here worth a second attempt.
 *
 * <h2>Where it is said</h2>
 *
 * The 1.12.2 build says it at the top of its settings screen. Here it is one
 * line in chat when the player is first in a world — see {@link UpdateNotice}
 * — with the link on it; clicking goes through the game's own confirmation,
 * which shows the address before anything opens.
