/**
 * Gathers everything the Vulkan terrain renderer needs to draw one layer.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not do yet</h2>
 *
 * It does not draw. Vanilla still renders the frame, and this only collects and
 * checks the inputs. That order is deliberate: handing the renderer a wrong
 * chunk list or a transposed matrix produces a black screen, and a black screen
 * says nothing about which of the two was wrong. Everything here is checkable
 * while the game still looks right.
 *
 * <h2>The five things a layer needs</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>The visible chunks</b>, as mirror slots, in the game's own order. Taken
 *     from the game rather than worked out: the first thing to prove is that we
 *     can draw what vanilla draws.</li>
 * <li><b>The camera</b>, which the game hands to this method.</li>
 * <li><b>The matrix</b>. On this version the game still drives the fixed
 *     function matrix stack, so the product is read back from OpenGL — the same
 *     route the 1.12.2 mod uses, and it has the advantage of being whatever the
 *     game actually set rather than whatever we think it set.</li>
 * <li><b>The block atlas</b>, by its OpenGL name.</li>
 * <li><b>The framebuffer size.</b></li>
 * </ol>
