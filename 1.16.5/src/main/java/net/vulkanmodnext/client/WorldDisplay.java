/**
 * What time it looks like, and what the weather looks like, on this screen only.
 *
 * <h2>What this is not</h2>
 *
 * Not a cheat and not a command. Nothing here is sent anywhere, nothing is
 * stored in the world, and no other player sees any of it. The server still
 * decides when it is night and whether it is raining — mobs still burn at
 * dawn, crops still grow, a storm still charges a creeper. This changes only
 * what the numbers look like to the code that draws the sky, and it changes
 * them on the way out of the world object rather than in it.
 *
 * That is the whole design rule, and it is what makes the feature safe to have
 * at all: the world is never written to. Switch any of this off and the next
 * frame is exactly what it would have been.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is wanted</h2>
 *
 * Every effect in this mod is judged by looking at the world, and half of them
 * only exist at particular times of day. A shadow is worth looking at in the
 * morning and invisible at noon; water reflects the sky at dusk and a flat grey
 * at midnight; bloom is a different thing in a cave than under the sun. Judging
 * a slider meant waiting for the world to come round to the right hour, which
 * is a long time to hold an impression of what the last value looked like.
