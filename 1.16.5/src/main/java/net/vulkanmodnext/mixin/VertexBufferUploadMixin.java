/**
 * Takes a copy of a chunk at the moment the game uploads it to OpenGL.
 *
 * <h2>Why a redirect and not an injection</h2>
 *
 * The bytes exist for exactly one statement: {@code popNextBuffer} hands them
 * over and the upload consumes them. At the head of the method they have not
 * been produced yet, and at the return they are gone. Redirecting the call is
 * the only place both sides can see them, and it hands the same pair straight
 * back, so vanilla's upload is unaffected.
 *
 * <p>This is the render thread, and this is where a mirror entry is actually
 * made. The copy the builder thread staged earlier is a fast path into it, not
 * a replacement for it — dropping this hook produced a renderer that reported
 * success on every layer and drew nothing at all.
