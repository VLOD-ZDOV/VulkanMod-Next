/**
 * Reads what a chunk builder has produced without taking it.
 *
 * The game hands a finished chunk over with {@code popNextBuffer}, which is
 * destructive: it advances a cursor and, on the last layer, clears the builder.
 * Calling it ourselves would take the geometry away from the upload that was
 * about to happen. So the same three numbers it uses are read directly, and
 * nothing moves.
 *
 * <p>What it reads: the bytes of the next layer live at
 * {@code [totalUploadedBytes, totalUploadedBytes + vertexCount * stride)}, and
 * the vertex count and format come from the draw state at
 * {@code lastRenderedCountIndex} — exactly the arithmetic {@code popNextBuffer}
 * performs one line later.
