 * walking the chunks the game has decided are visible.
 *
 * <p>It hands the layer to Vulkan and cancels vanilla's draw only when Vulkan
 * says it drew it. Every path that is not a plain success — the setting off,
 * the renderer not up, no chunks, or anything thrown — leaves the method to run
 * as it always did. That is the whole safety of this hook: the failure mode is
