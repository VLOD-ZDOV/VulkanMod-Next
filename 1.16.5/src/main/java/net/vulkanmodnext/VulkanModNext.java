 * Where the port starts. At this stage it does one thing: prove it is running.
 *
 * <p>The package is deliberately the same as the 1.12.2 mod's. Eighteen
 * thousand lines of this project are the Vulkan half, which knows nothing about
 * Minecraft, and the whole point of the port is that they come across
 * unchanged. Nobody outside the jar ever sees a package name; the mod id, which
 * they do see, is separate and is not this.
