     * Highest Java feature release this mod has been shown to survive.
     *
     * <h2>What the danger actually is</h2>
     *
     * LWJGL installs its function tables by patching the JVM's JNI function
     * table, and it can only do that for a layout it knows. On one it does not
     * it warns and carries on with a corrupted table: OpenGL calls then return
     * nonsense — the device UUID query answers with its own arguments — and the
     * JVM segfaults soon after, in our observation inside a JIT compiler
     * thread, far from anything this mod wrote. Vulkan is unaffected, because
     * its entry points hang off the instance and device objects rather than
     * that table, so the failure looks like a driver problem rather than what
     * it is. That is worth declining cleanly for.
     *
     * <h2>Why the number is not a Java version</h2>
     *
     * It reads like one and it is not. What LWJGL switches on is the <b>JNI</b>
     * version the JVM reports, and that only moves when the JNI specification
     * does — which is far less often than Java releases. The bundled LWJGL
     * knows JNI up to 24; Java 25 and Java 26 both still report 24, so both are
     * fine, and the ceiling that used to sit at 21 was refusing platforms that
     * were never in danger. It cost this mod every Cleanroom instance on a
     * modern JVM: the renderer simply never started, and the line explaining
     * why named a limit that was not real.
     *
     * <h2>What this number now means</h2>
     *
     * The newest Java this has been run on and seen to work, which is a fact
     * rather than an inference: on Java 26 the bundled LWJGL reports JNI 24,
     * warns about nothing, creates a Vulkan instance, enumerates the device and
     * reads its 280 extensions. A release past this one is refused not because
     * it is known to break but because it is not known to work — and
     * {@code -Dvulkanmodnext.javaCeiling=NN} moves the line for anyone willing
     * to find out. The JNI version is written to the log at startup, so the
     * next person to raise this has the number in front of them.
     *
     * Minecraft 1.12.2 itself runs on Java 8, so none of this arises outside a
     * modernised platform such as Cleanroom.
