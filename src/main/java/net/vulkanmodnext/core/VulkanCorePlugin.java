 * The mixin configs are split in two. The always-on one holds settings and
 * game-side optimisations, which touch classes any renderer leaves alone. The
 * second one captures chunk geometry for the Vulkan renderer and rewrites the
 * classes OptiFine and the old shader mods replace wholesale — applying it
 * alongside them fails at class-load time, long before any runtime check in
 * TerrainHooks could step in. So when such a renderer is present, that config
 * is simply never registered: the game boots on OptiFine's renderer with this
 * mod's optimisations still in place.
