/**
 * Which of this mod's class patches belong together, and which of them the mod
 * cannot do without.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * A mixin that cannot be applied does not fail alone. The class it was aimed at
 * fails to transform, the launch classloader remembers that failure, and every
 * later attempt to load that class reports it as missing — so a broken patch on
 * {@code RenderGlobal} surfaces as {@code NoClassDefFoundError:
 * net/minecraft/client/renderer/RenderGlobal}, naming neither the patch nor the
 * mod that wrote it. Twelve of the patches below aim at that one class, and so
 * do Alfheim, VintageFix and LoliASM. Whoever loses that argument, the message
 * on screen is the same and points at nobody.
 *
 * A patch that has been switched off before class-load time cannot lose that
 * argument at all, and that is the whole idea here: give the user a switch that
 * removes a set of patches from consideration entirely, rather than a mod that
 * either works or does not start.
 *
 * <h2>Why a group and not a single patch</h2>
 *
 * Because half a feature is worse than none of it. Drawing creatures through
 * Vulkan takes six patches — one to know when the pass starts, three to read
 * the model, one to drop vanilla's blob shadow, one to catch the colour the
 * game lays over a creature that has been hurt — and five of six means
 * creatures captured and never drawn, or drawn without the shadow that was
 * supposed to replace the one just removed. So the unit that can be switched
 * off is the feature, and it goes off whole.
 *
 * <h2>Why not compare the class against a known-good checksum</h2>
 *
 * The obvious version of this is to hash the target class and stand down when
 * the hash is unfamiliar. It cannot work, for three separate reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The decision has to be made before any mixin is applied, and mixins from
 *     every mod are applied together in one pass. At the moment of the decision
 *     another mod's patches have not touched the bytes yet, so there is nothing
 *     to see.</li>
 * <li>There is no single "untouched" hash to compare against. Forge itself
 *     patches {@code RenderGlobal} through its binary patches, so the reference
 *     would differ per Forge build, per fork, and between the development and
 *     the shipped mappings.</li>
 * <li>It answers the wrong question. "Did somebody edit this class" is not
 *     "is the thing I need still here" — most edits are irrelevant to us, and a
 *     hash cannot tell the two apart, so it would stand down constantly and for
 *     no reason.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * What replaces it is in {@link VulkanMixinErrorHandler}: rather than guessing
 * in advance whether a patch will fit, the mod finds out, and remembers. A
 * group whose patch failed is written down and skipped on the next launch — the
 * one honest signal that a patch does not fit is that it did not fit.
