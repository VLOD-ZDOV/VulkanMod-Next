/**
 * Makes the game's depth buffer <em>be</em> this renderer's depth image.
 *
 * <h2>What it removes</h2>
 *
 * The frame used to move a full screen of depth twice. Out, after the opaque
 * pass, so the creatures the game draws would be hidden behind hills; and back
 * again, before the translucent pass, so water would be hidden behind the
 * creatures. Both are hardware copies and neither is cheap at eight megapixels
 * — measured together with the colour composite they are 0.13 ms of a 1.88 ms
 * frame, which is the largest thing left in this renderer that is not drawing.
 *
 * Nothing has to be copied between two buffers that are one buffer. The
 * composite quad stops exporting depth as well, which gives it early-Z back.
 *
 * <h2>Why the game does not notice</h2>
 *
 * A framebuffer attachment names an object, not storage — the same reason the
 * game may resize its window without rebuilding anything. So the game's own
 * framebuffer keeps its identity, its colour texture and its size, and only the
 * thing hanging off its depth attachment changes: a renderbuffer it made for
 * itself becomes a texture backed by memory Vulkan also sees. Everything that
 * clears it, tests against it or writes into it goes on working unchanged.
 *
 * <h2>Why it can be given back</h2>
 *
 * The renderbuffer the game made is not deleted, only unhooked, so putting it
 * back is one call. That matters because the offer can be withdrawn mid-session
 * — the renderer fails, the terrain is switched off, the window is resized and
 * the images are rebuilt — and a framebuffer left pointing at a texture that no
 * longer exists is a black world, not an error message.
 *
 * <h2>What it costs</h2>
 *
 * An ordering that used to be implicit. Two APIs now write one image inside one
 * frame, and the moment the game has finished with it has to be stated rather
 * than assumed; that half lives on the Vulkan side, in
 * {@code beginFrameDepthHandover}.
