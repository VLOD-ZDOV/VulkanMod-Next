 * Stopwatches on the two vanilla methods that walk the visible-chunk list.
 *
 * Standing still at render distance 64 over an ocean, with the world built and
 * uploads stopped, the frame takes 45 ms and everything this mod can account
 * for adds up to under two of them. Reading the 1.12.2 source narrowed the
 * suspects to work that is upstream of where our mixins interpose, and so is
 * invisible to every timer we had:
 *
 * - {@code renderEntities} runs twice a frame (Forge renders pass 0 and pass 1)
 *   and each call scans the visible-chunk list twice, once for entities and
 *   once for tile entities, doing a chunk lookup per element. At 17 778 chunks
 *   that is about 71 000 lookups a frame for an ocean that contains nearly
 *   nothing.
 * - {@code renderBlockLayer} filters the visible-chunk list into a draw list
 *   before handing it to the container we hook. That loop runs for all four
 *   layers, including the three we draw ourselves, so taking a layer over into
 *   Vulkan never removed it.
 *
 * Those are structural readings of the code, not measurements — the point of
 * this class is to stop guessing. Three hypotheses in two days died to a
 * counter that took twenty lines.
