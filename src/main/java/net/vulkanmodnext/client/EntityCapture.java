/**
 * Reads the geometry and placement of every entity part the game draws, and
 * draws nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists before anything visible</h2>
 *
 * Entities are the largest remaining piece of the world this renderer does not
 * own, and they are also the part of the game other mods hook hardest — so the
 * way taking them over goes wrong is not a wrong pixel but somebody else's mod
 * no longer drawing. Nothing here is taken over. What it produces is the two
 * numbers that decide whether taking it over is possible at all.
 *
 * <h2>Where the placement comes from, and why that is the whole problem</h2>
 *
 * A part's shape is fixed and is read once. Where the part <i>is</i> lives
 * entirely in OpenGL's matrix stack, built up by the game as it walks the
 * skeleton. The obvious way to get it is to ask the driver at the moment the
 * game is about to draw — and that was measured at two to three microseconds a
 * part, for half a millisecond to a full millisecond of frame at a few hundred
 * parts. The whole Vulkan terrain pass is a third of a millisecond, so that
 * approach was over before it began.
 *
 * The transform a part applies is not a mystery, though. It is
 * {@code translate(offset) · translate(rotationPoint · scale) · Rz · Ry · Rx},
 * every term of it a field the part already holds, and children are drawn
 * inside their parent's frame. Composing that is arithmetic. The driver is then
 * needed once for the whole creature, not once for each of its bones.
 *
 * <h2>The check that makes this an experiment rather than a hope</h2>
 *
 * Composed transforms are compared against the driver's own on a sample of
 * parts. Getting the order of three rotations wrong, or a scale applied to the
 * wrong term, produces a creature that is subtly inside out — and inside out in
 * a way that is obvious in a screenshot and invisible in a number, which is the
 * wrong way round for something not being drawn yet. The disagreement count and
 * the largest error are reported beside the cost.

     * session that costs two or three microseconds. In a loaded scene it was
     * measured at around fifty — and at ten checks a frame that is half a
     * millisecond, which is more than the whole vanilla entity pass costs and
