/**
 * Translates the settings screen, keyed off the English text already in the
 * code rather than off keys written beside it.
 *
 * The screen is built from about thirty options, each with a name, a paragraph
 * of description and sometimes a note about when it takes effect, plus page and
 * group titles and the chrome around them. Turning that into keys the usual way
 * means a second string next to every first one, and it means the code stops
 * saying what it puts on screen.
 *
 * Here the key is derived from the English: {@code "Dynamic Lights"} becomes
 * {@code vulkanmodnext.option.dynamic_lights}, and its description
 * {@code vulkanmodnext.tooltip.dynamic_lights}. The English stays in the source
 * as the argument it always was, and doubles as the fallback.
 *
 * <h2>What that buys, and what it costs</h2>
 *
 * A missing or misspelled key cannot produce a blank row or a raw key on
 * screen: nothing translated simply reads as English, which is what an
 * untranslated mod looks like anyway. A language file can therefore be partial,
 * and a new option is translatable without being translated.
 *
 * The cost is that renaming an option in English silently orphans its
 * translations. That is a real risk and the reason for
 * {@code -Dvulkanmodnext.dumpLang=true}: it writes out every key the screen
 * actually asks for, taken from the live objects rather than from parsing the
 * source, which is how the English file is generated in the first place and how
 * a rename is caught.
