/**
 * Says out loud when a setting is switched on and cannot do anything.
 *
 * <h2>What went wrong without it</h2>
 *
 * A tester turned dynamic lights on, watched for ninety seconds, and reported
 * that dynamic lights do not work. They were right about everything they saw.
 * The Vulkan terrain renderer was off, every effect in this mod is code inside
 * it, and the setting was therefore doing exactly nothing — while the settings
 * screen showed the switch on, the log said the Vulkan foundation was active,
 * and the only place the truth appeared was a line in a diagnostics file that
 * has to be enabled first and then read carefully.
 *
 * Three separate sources of information, all of them true, adding up to the
 * wrong conclusion. That is not a tester's mistake to make.
 *
 * <h2>Where it is said</h2>
 *
 * In the ordinary log, which is what a report comes with, and again in the
 * diagnostics snapshot right under the values it explains. Once per change of
 * state rather than once a frame: this is a note about a configuration, and a
 * configuration is only worth mentioning when it moves.
 *
 * <h2>Why the list is written out</h2>
 *
 * Every effect could be found by walking the published settings and treating
 * anything non-zero as on, which would never need touching again. It is spelt
 * out instead because this text is read by someone who is stuck, and
 * "foliageSway=40" is not what they called it when they turned it on. The
 * cost of that choice is that an effect added later has to be added here too,
 * and the check below is what makes forgetting visible.
