/**
 * Marks the diagnostics log with the things that decide what a measurement
 * means: where the camera is, and what the player just did to put it there.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is here</h2>
 *
 * A frame breakdown is a number per second with no idea what was on screen. Two
 * flights over different ground produce two sets of numbers that cannot be
 * compared, and the only record of the difference was the person's memory of
 * where they had flown. That is not a hypothetical: it happened, and it cost a
 * measurement.
 *
 * So every snapshot now carries the camera's position and heading, and the
 * events that move it are written into the same file as they happen — the
 * command that teleported, the world that loaded. A route can then be matched
 * afterwards by reading the log rather than by remembering the flight.
 *
 * <h2>What is not recorded</h2>
 *
 * Chat is not. Only lines beginning with a slash are, because those are the
 * ones that move the camera or change the world, and ordinary chat on a server
 * is other people's conversation.
