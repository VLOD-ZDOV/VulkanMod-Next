/**
 * A round, warm sun, drawn rather than shipped.
 *
 * <h2>Why a picture built at runtime and not a file</h2>
 *
 * Because then it is a slider. Vanilla's sun is a square texture on a fixed
 * quad, and the quad is not ours to resize without cutting into the middle of
 * a vanilla method — but the disc inside the texture is entirely ours, so how
 * much of that square it fills *is* the size control, for free. The same is
 * true of its colour and of how soft its edge is. A file would have frozen all
 * three at whatever looked right on one machine.
 *
 * It also keeps this mod's promise about shader packs: nothing is copied from
 * anybody. A disc with a warm falloff is arithmetic, and the arithmetic is
 * here in the open.
 *
 * <h2>How it is drawn</h2>
 *
 * Vanilla draws the sun added to the sky rather than blended over it, so what
 * matters is the falloff: a hard circle reads as a sticker, and a circle that
 * fades too far reads as fog. The edge is smoothed over a small band, and
 * outside the disc there is a much wider, much fainter halo — that halo is
 * what makes it look like light rather than like a shape.
