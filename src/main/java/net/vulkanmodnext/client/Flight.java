/**
 * A flight the game makes by itself, so that a measurement does not need
 * somebody to sit and fly it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * Everything this renderer is judged by happens while the camera moves. Half
 * the terrain code does nothing at all while you stand still, an effect keyed
 * to the screen only misbehaves while you turn, and the numbers that matter —
 * the worst frame in a hundred, the chunk that took a tenth of a second to
 * build — appear in flight and nowhere else. Which meant every open question
 * here ended in "load a world, fly this way, and read the line back to me",
 * and a question asked that way is answered once and never re-asked. A route
 * flown by the game itself is answered as often as it is worth answering, and
 * two runs of the same route are comparable in a way that two hands on a
 * keyboard are not.
 *
 * <h2>What it does</h2>
 *
 * With {@code -Dvulkanmodnext.flight=<route>} the client waits for the main
 * menu, makes a world of its own from a fixed seed, waits for the chunks
 * around the spawn to be built, flies the named route, takes screenshots along
 * it, marks the diagnostics file at each one and quits. Nothing is pressed and
 * nothing is clicked; every call here is one the game makes for itself.
 *
 * <h2>Routes</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code hover} — stand still, look one way. The shape of the
 *       measurement that has been used against OptiFine so far.</li>
 *   <li>{@code spin} — stand still and turn once all the way round, ending at
 *       the angle it started at. The route that catches anything keyed to the
 *       screen rather than to the world: the first and last frames are of the
 *       same view, so a difference between them is the fault itself rather
 *       than a matter of opinion.</li>
 *   <li>{@code line} — fly in a straight line at a constant speed, which is
 *       what makes chunks arrive and is therefore where the stutter lives.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * It never decides whether a picture is good. It puts frames and numbers on
 * disk, in a state something else can compare; the judgement stays where it
 * was.
