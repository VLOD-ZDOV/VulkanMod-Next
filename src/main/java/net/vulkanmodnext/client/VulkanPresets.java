/**
 * Named starting points for the settings screen.
 *
 * A preset is a one-shot write, not a mode: it sets a group of options and
 * then stops existing, so anything changed afterwards simply stays changed.
 * That is why the rows are buttons rather than a selector — a selector would
 * keep claiming a preset is active after it stopped being true.
 *
 * Every preset writes the whole set of values it owns, never a subset. That
 * sounds like bookkeeping and is the difference between a preset and a trap:
 * one that only sets what it wants to lower cannot undo the one applied before
 * it, so going back up the list left the world looking like the heaviest preset
 * anyone had tried that session, with no row on the screen admitting it. The
 * lists below are therefore deliberately repetitive.
 *
 * Render distance is the one value treated differently: every preset caps it
 * and none of them raises it, because raising a distance somebody chose takes
 * frames away without saying so. Beautiful used to be the exception and set
 * thirty-two outright, on the theory that asking for the best-looking world
 * and being left at eight chunks was the failure in the other direction. It
 * was not: measured, the distance bought that preset nothing — its effects are
 * paid per pixel — while the chunk rebuilding at thirty-two is exactly what
 * turns a four-millisecond frame into a thirty-millisecond one every twentieth
 * frame, which is the stutter the preset was blamed for.

     * what can be spared to go faster on a capable machine, this one asks what
     * has to go for the game to be playable at all. On a laptop with shared
     * memory and a sixty-hertz screen, frames above sixty are not a gain — they
     * are heat and fan noise for pictures nobody sees, which is why this is the
     * one preset that puts a ceiling on rather than taking one off.
