/**

 * Vanilla draws world geometry in layer order SOLID → CUTOUT_MIPPED → CUTOUT
 * (then entities, then TRANSLUCENT). The Vulkan path accumulates the three
 * opaque-ish layers into one shared VRAM frame and composites it (color +
 * depth) into the game's framebuffer at the CUTOUT call — before entities, so
 * they occlude correctly. TRANSLUCENT goes through Vulkan as well, in a pass of
 * its own after entities, unless Vulkan Water and Glass is switched off.
 *
 * Any failure permanently falls back to vanilla rendering: losing the world's

     * Terrain lighting here is the game's own 16x16 light map, read once as a
     * live array and copied to the GPU whenever it changes. That works with a
     * lighting mod for the same reason it works with the seasons: whatever
     * writes into that array, this renderer follows.
     *
     * What it does not follow is a mod that replaces the texture rather than
     * the array — uploading its own colours straight to GL, or swapping in a
     * different {@code DynamicTexture} altogether. Then vanilla's array stays
     * as it was, the terrain is lit by it, and everything the game draws is lit
     * by the mod. The world would be lit two different ways in one frame, with
     * nothing in any log to say so.
     *
     * <h2>Why a check and not a fix</h2>
     *
     * There is no fix from here: if the colours never pass through an array we
     * can see, the only way to follow them is to read the texture back off the
     * GPU every time it changes, which is a stall per tick for a case that may
     * not exist. What can be done is to notice, name the number, and say it
     * once — so a report of "the ground is lit wrong with mod X" is one line in
     * a log rather than a week.
     *
     * <p>Cheap: two identity comparisons on the frame that draws SOLID.
