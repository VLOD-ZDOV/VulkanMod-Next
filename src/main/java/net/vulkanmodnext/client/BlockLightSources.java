/**
 * The light-emitting blocks near the camera — torches, lava, glowstone, a fire.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are wanted when the game already lights them</h2>
 *
 * Vanilla's own block light is a flood fill through air: it reaches around
 * corners correctly and it is completely flat, because it is a number per block
 * with no idea where the light came from. A torch on a wall and a torch on the
 * floor light a room identically. What this renderer can now do — trace a ray
 * from a surface to a source — turns that number back into a direction and a
 * shadow, and doing it to a carried torch was the first thing anybody noticed.
 * Doing it to the torches that are already there is the same trick applied to
 * the ninety-nine percent of light in a world that is not being carried.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a scan and not a subscription</h2>
 *
 * The game tells nobody when a light-emitting block is placed in a way this
 * could listen to cheaply, and the alternative — asking the world what is in
 * every block near the camera, every frame — is a lookup per block per frame
 * for an answer that changes when somebody places a torch. So it is scanned on
 * a slow clock and when the camera has moved far enough to be looking at
 * different blocks. Placing a torch lights the room within a fraction of a
 * second rather than within a frame, which nobody can see.
 *
 * <h2>Three things that make a fifty-block radius affordable</h2>
 *
 * A hundred and one blocks across is a million blocks, and asking the world
 * about a million blocks four times a second is not a search, it is a stall.
 * The volume is cut down before it is ever looked at:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Sections, not blocks.</b> The world stores blocks in sixteen-cubed
 *     sections and knows which of them contain nothing but air. Above ground
 *     that is most of them, and each one skipped is four thousand blocks not
 *     read.</li>
 * <li><b>The game's own block-light array is the filter.</b> A block that emits
 *     light necessarily has block light at its own position — that is what
 *     emitting means. The nibble array holding it is two thousand bytes a
 *     section, read straight rather than a nibble at a time, and outdoors in
 *     daylight it is all zeroes: sunlight is stored separately. So a section is
 *     dismissed by two thousand byte comparisons instead of four thousand block
 *     lookups, and only the handful of positions that already have light are
 *     asked what block is there.</li>
 * <li><b>Spread over frames.</b> Even reduced, a full sweep is work, and doing
 *     it in one frame is a hitch four times a second. A fixed number of
 *     sections is done per frame, nearest first, and the result is published
 *     only when the sweep finishes — so the list never contains half a world.
 *     Nearest first also means running out of room stops the sweep instead of
 *     filling it with whatever came first.</li>
 * </ol>
