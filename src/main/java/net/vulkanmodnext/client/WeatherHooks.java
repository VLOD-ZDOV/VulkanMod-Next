/**
 * Rain and snow, taken at the point the game hands them to OpenGL.
 *
 * Unlike the particle path this does not replace the loop. {@code
 * renderRainSnow} is a hundred and fifty lines of column walking, biome
 * lookups, seeded randomness and Forge hooks, and reproducing it would mean
 * owning all of that and getting it wrong the first time a mod changed the
 * weather. What is replaced is two calls inside it: which sheet is bound, and
 * the draw.
 *
 * <p>The weather quads arrive already relative to the camera — the game sets a
 * translation on the builder before filling it — which is the same origin the
 * terrain matrix is built around, so they need no adjustment.
