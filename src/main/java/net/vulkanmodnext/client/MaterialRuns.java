/**
 * What each stretch of a chunk's geometry is made of.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * The renderer draws terrain in vanilla's four layers, and a layer is not a
 * material. TRANSLUCENT is water and stained glass together; CUTOUT is grass
 * and torches and rails and ladders together. Every effect worth having next
 * needs to tell those apart — water wants a fresnel term and moving normals,
 * foliage wants to sway and to be lit as a soft volume rather than as the two
 * flat vertical quads it actually is, and a ray needs to know what it passed
 * through. The vertex carries no such thing: 28 bytes of position, colour,
 * texture and light map, and that is the game's format, mirrored byte for
 * byte.
 *
 * <h2>Where the information is</h2>
 *
 * It exists exactly once, for a moment, in {@code RenderChunk.rebuildChunk}:
 * the loop walks the blocks of a chunk and calls {@code renderBlock} for each
 * one. Before that call the block state is in hand; after it, the vertices it
 * produced are on the end of the layer's buffer. Nowhere later does anything
 * know which block a vertex came from.
 *
 * So the block's material is recorded against the range of vertices it wrote,
 * and consecutive blocks of the same material are merged into one run. A chunk
 * of stone is one run; a hillside of grass and dirt is a handful. What comes
 * out is a small table per chunk layer, in vertex order, which the Vulkan side
 * can later turn into a buffer beside the geometry rather than inside it —
 * leaving the mirrored vertex format untouched, which is the whole point.
 *
 * <h2>Threads</h2>
 *
 * Chunks are built on worker threads and uploaded from either a worker or the
 * render thread, so a table is written by one thread and read by another. The
 * handover is the buffer itself: a table is keyed by the {@link BufferBuilder}
 * the vertices went into, and whoever uploads that buffer takes the table with
 * them. {@code BufferBuilder} does not override equals or hashCode, so the map
 * is an identity map already, and there are only ever a few builders alive —
 * four per build thread.
