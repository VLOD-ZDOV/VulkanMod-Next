/**
 * Which animated sprites are actually in front of you, so that the rest can be
 * left alone.
 *
 * <h2>What vanilla does</h2>
 *
 * Once a tick the block atlas walks every sprite that has an animation and
 * uploads its next frame to the card. Every one, every tick, whether or not a
 * single block using it is on screen — water, lava, fire, portals, sea
 * lanterns, prismarine, magma, and in a modpack several hundred machines
 * besides. The upload is small and the count is what costs: on a weak machine
 * it is a visible slice of every twentieth of a second.
 *
 * <h2>What this does instead</h2>
 *
 * A chunk records which animated sprites its blocks use while it is being
 * built, which is the one moment the answer is knowable at all — after that
 * the geometry is texture coordinates in a buffer and the sprite is gone. Each
 * frame the chunks that are actually being drawn contribute their sprites to
 * one set, and the tick updates that set rather than all of them.
 *
 * <h2>The two rules that keep it honest</h2>
 *
 * A chunk that has no record contributes <em>everything</em>. That covers the
 * chunks built before this was switched on, and it covers the case where the
 * patch that records them is disabled: the failure is "no saving", never "the
 * world stopped moving".
 *
 * Anything drawn that is not terrain is vouched for another way. An item
 * model marks its sprites as it is drawn — in the hand, in a menu, in a frame
 * or on the ground — and they stay marked for a second or two. Water, lava,
 * fire and portals are always updated: fluids are drawn by a renderer that
 * never asks a model, fire burns on creatures as well as on blocks, and they
 * are what a player looks at when they want to know whether the game is still
 * running.
 *
 * <p>What remains, and it is why this ships switched off: an animated block
 * texture drawn by something that is neither a chunk nor an item model — a
 * block entity renderer, a creature, a mod's own geometry — freezes while no
 * chunk in sight uses it. There is no "never reported by a chunk" rule behind
 * this; a sprite is updated only for the reasons above.
