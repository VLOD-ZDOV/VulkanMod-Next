/**
 * Tells the player, in the chat they are already looking at, when this mod has
 * stopped drawing the world.
 *
 * Everything this renderer does happens silently until someone opens a log, and
 * the failure it can have is the quietest of all: the world keeps being drawn,
 * by OpenGL, and looks almost the same. Without a word on the screen the only
 * symptom is that the settings in this mod stop meaning anything — which reads
 * as "the mod is broken" rather than "the mod stood aside", and the two want
 * very different things from the player.
 *
 * Printed locally. This never reaches the server or anybody else's chat: it is
 * put straight into this client's chat window, which is the only place a
 * message about this client's graphics belongs.
