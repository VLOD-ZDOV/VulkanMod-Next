/**
 * Which patches of the block atlas belong to which material.
 *
 * <h2>Why the translucent layer needs its own answer</h2>
 *
 * Everywhere else a material is recorded per vertex while the chunk is built
 * ({@link MaterialRuns}). That cannot work for the translucent layer, and the
 * reason is not an oversight anywhere: the game sorts that layer's quads by
 * distance after building it, and sorts them again — without rebuilding — every
 * time the camera moves far enough, so that water draws back to front. A label
 * numbered by vertex describes the wrong surface the moment the quads move.
 * Marked only when a chunk's translucent layer was a single material, water
 * went grey next to a single block of ice.
 *
 * What survives the sort is what the quad carries with it. Its texture does:
 * the sort moves whole quads, and a quad's texture coordinates move with it.
 * So for this one layer the material is read off the atlas instead — the water
 * texture is water wherever it ends up in the buffer, and no reordering can
 * separate the two.
 *
 * <h2>What that costs</h2>
 *
 * A texture is not a material, and this is honest about being a lookup of
 * specific textures rather than a general answer. A modded block with a texture
 * of its own is not recognised; a block borrowing the water texture counts as
 * water, which for anything that makes water look like water is the answer you
 * wanted anyway. It is used only where the per-vertex labels cannot be, and the
 * two are never asked at once.
