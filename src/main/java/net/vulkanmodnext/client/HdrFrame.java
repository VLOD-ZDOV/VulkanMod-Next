/**
 * Gives the game's own frame room above white, and takes it away again.
 *
 * <h2>Why the frame and not a target of our own</h2>
 *
 * Everything drawn between this mod's composite and the point where the picture
 * is finished — creatures, particles, weather, the sky, the game's own
 * post-processing — is vanilla code this mod does not intercept. A parallel
 * floating target would therefore have to be filled by copying the frame back
 * and forth around all of it, which costs more than changing what the frame is
 * made of. So the frame itself is changed.
 *
 * <h2>Why no mixin</h2>
 *
 * The obvious way is a {@code @ModifyConstant} on the format in
 * {@code Framebuffer}, and it is wrong: that targets the <em>class</em>, and
 * four places in the game and Forge build a {@code Framebuffer} — the main
 * frame, the loading screen, and every buffer of the vanilla shader groups
 * (creeper, spider, invert, entity outline) — plus any mod that builds one of
 * its own. All of them would silently change format, and the shader groups
 * would be reading and writing a format their own code never expected.
 *
 * This touches one object instead: whatever {@link Minecraft#getFramebuffer()}
 * returns, and nothing else, ever. Reallocating the colour texture of an
 * existing framebuffer keeps the attachment valid, because the attachment names
 * the texture object rather than its storage — which is the same reason the
 * game may resize its window without rebuilding anything.
 *
 * <h2>Why it can be taken away again</h2>
 *
 * A floating frame is only safe while something closes the range back down
 * before the picture is shown, and the only thing that does that is this mod's
 * tone pass, which lives on the Vulkan side. If the Vulkan side is not there —
 * it failed, it was switched off, the renderer stood aside for another mod —
 * then nothing resolves, everything above white is cut off at the moment of
 * display, and the player is left with a worse picture for having asked for a
 * better one.
 *
 * So the format is not a decision made once at startup. It is asked again every
 * frame, and the answer includes whether the resolve is going to run. Losing
 * the renderer mid-session puts the frame back to eight bits by itself.
