/**
 * Pushes the game's distance fog further out, or pulls it in.
 *
 * Written after reading how Celeritas Extra does it (LGPL-3.0,
 * github.com/Sumire-Labs/Celeritas-Extra), which took the idea in turn from
 * Sodium Extra. Not a copy of their code — the arithmetic is two lines and the
 * plumbing is ours — but the rule below is theirs and is the whole reason this
 * is worth doing carefully rather than quickly.
 *
 * <h2>The rule</h2>
 *
 * Some of this game's fog is scenery and some of it is information. Blindness,
 * being under water, being in lava: each of those is told to the player almost
 * entirely by fog, and a setting that thins the haze on a mountain range must
 * not also tell somebody they can see through lava. So the scale is applied to
 * the fog of an ordinary view and to nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a change to OpenGL and not to this renderer</h2>
 *
 * The terrain shader does not decide its own fog. It reads the game's — start,
 * end and density, out of GL, once a frame — precisely so that the blocks
 * cannot disagree with the sky, the creatures and everything else the game
 * draws around them. So changing it here changes it everywhere, in one place,
 * and this renderer follows without knowing anything happened.
 *
 * <h2>Why only linear fog</h2>
 *
 * Vanilla uses linear fog for distance and exponential fog for the states
 * above. Scaling a density would be a different sum with a different meaning,
 * and the only fog that wants scaling is the one measured in blocks.

        // believes the fog still starts where it put it, so next frame it sets
        // the same number, sees no change and sends nothing — and this scaling
        // lands on its own previous answer instead of on the game's. Three
        // becomes nine becomes twenty-seven, once a frame, until the numbers
        // stop being numbers, and the terrain shader reading them out of GL
        // fogs the entire world away. Told properly, the tracker sees a value
        // it did not write, restores the game's next frame, and this scales it
        // once more from the same place every time.
        //
        // Both ends, so the band the fog thickens across keeps its shape rather
        // than stretching from a fixed start — pushing only the far end makes a
        // long soft smear instead of a wall of haze further away.
