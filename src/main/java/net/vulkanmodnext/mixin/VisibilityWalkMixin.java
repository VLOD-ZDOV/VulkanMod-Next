/**
 * Counts what makes the game redo its visibility walk.
 *
 * The walk is the flood fill in {@code RenderGlobal.setupTerrain} that decides
 * which chunks are on screen. The game's own profiler puts it at 25% to 48% of
 * the frame at render distance 64 — the largest single item, some eight times
 * what drawing the world costs — and it reruns whenever
 * {@code displayListEntitiesDirty} is set. Two writes set it, both running
 * after the walk, later in the same frame:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // setupTerrain, in the loop that refills the rebuild queue
 * if (renderchunk4.needsUpdate() || set.contains(renderchunk4)) {
 *     this.displayListEntitiesDirty = true;
 *
 * // updateChunks, every frame
 * this.displayListEntitiesDirty |= this.renderDispatcher.runChunkUploads(finishTimeNano);
 * </pre>
 *
 * So any visible chunk waiting to be rebuilt, and any chunk finishing its
 * upload, buys a full walk on the next frame.
 *
 * <h2>What this used to do, and why it does not</h2>
 *
 * Those two writes used to be rate-limited here — held back while the camera
 * stood still until a timer elapsed. That is gone. Not because it was broken,
 * but because it was measured: of ten thousand requests a second, nine and a
 * half thousand come from the camera moving rather than from a chunk
 * finishing, and the limiter deliberately never touched those. There is no
 * interval at which it would have helped more than the seed cache already
 * does, so its setting had no position worth choosing, stood at zero, and made
 * every branch under it unreachable.
 *
 * <h2>What is left, and why the class is</h2>
 *
 * The counting. "The walk ran on 1882 frames of 2316, from 136399 requests, of
 * which 102198 were the camera moving" is the sentence that says where the
 * frame went, and nothing else in the game can say it — the flag is written
 * from several places that share nothing but the field. Three are watched
 * here, and only two of those arm it: the third is vanilla clearing it as the
 * walk begins. The write near the top of {@code setupTerrain} that folds
 * camera movement in (PUTFIELD ordinal 0) is deliberately not redirected.
 *
 * Camera movement is judged against this class's own record of the previous
 * frame, not vanilla's: the game overwrites its {@code lastViewEntity*} fields
 * near the top of {@code setupTerrain}, before the write watched here, so
 * comparing against those compares a frame to itself and never sees movement.
