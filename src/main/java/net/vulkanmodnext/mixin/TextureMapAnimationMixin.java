/**
 * Lets animated block textures be turned off.
 *
 * Every animated sprite in the atlas uploads a new frame to the GPU each tick,
 * whether or not a single one of its blocks is on screen. Vanilla has no
 * switch for it, and with a modpack's worth of machines and fluids the uploads
 * add up to real frame time. With animations off this is the blunt version:
 * off means off, everywhere. With Smart Animations on, only the sprites that
 * something on screen is using are stepped (see {@code AnimatedSprites}).
