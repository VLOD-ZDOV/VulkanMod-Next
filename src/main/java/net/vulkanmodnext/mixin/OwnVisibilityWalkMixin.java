/**
 * Replaces the flood fill that decides which chunks are on screen.
 *
 * The search itself lives in {@link VisibilityWalk}, which explains why it is
 * shaped the way it is. This class is only the join: it decides whether the
 * replacement can be used at all, reproduces vanilla's seeding, and hands the
 * frame back untouched whenever the answer is anything but a plain yes.
 *
 * <h2>Where it interposes</h2>
 *
 * Vanilla guards the whole search with
 * {@code if (!flag && this.displayListEntitiesDirty)}. Redirecting that one
 * field read is the smallest cut that removes exactly the search and nothing
 * else — returning false there skips vanilla's block, and everything after it
 * (refilling the rebuild queue, the frustum capture, the near-chunk rebuild)
 * runs unchanged over the list this produced. Overwriting {@code setupTerrain}
 * outright, which is the usual approach, would take those with it.
 *
 * <h2>What is handed back to vanilla</h2>
 *
 * Each of these leaves the frame entirely to the game rather than approximating
 * it, and each is counted, so a report says how often the replacement was not
 * the thing being measured:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The camera above or below the world. Vanilla seeds that case from the
 *     whole grid ring using boxes stretched to infinity, and an infinite
 *     coordinate against a plane normal of exactly zero is NaN — which vanilla's
 *     chain of comparisons treats as "not rejected" in a way no rewrite
 *     reproduces by accident.</li>
 * <li>A camera that is not the game's own {@code Frustum}.</li>
 * <li>Running out of records mid-walk, which means the record type could not be
 *     reached by reflection at all.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The two cases that are implemented, because they are easy to lose</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Sealed in.</b> With no face reachable from the block the eye is in,
 *     vanilla draws the camera's own chunk and stops. Losing this draws nothing
 *     at all when standing inside a solid block, which no ordinary test finds.</li>
 * <li><b>Spectator inside an opaque block.</b> There vanilla turns its own
 *     direction culling off for the frame, otherwise a spectator flying through
 *     stone would see the world cut away.</li>
 * </ul>
