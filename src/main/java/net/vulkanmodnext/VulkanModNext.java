/**
 * Where the mod starts, and the only class in it Forge knows the name of.
 *
 * <p>Almost nothing happens here. What does happen is ordered, and the order is
 * the point: the settings are read first because everything after them asks
 * what they say; the diagnostics capture is started second so that every line
 * from here on is kept, including the lines of whatever fails next; and the
 * three things that must work even when Vulkan does not — the zoom, the
 * settings screen, the update check — are registered before anything that can
 * fail is touched.
 *
 * <p>The renderer itself is not started from here at all. It lives on a class
 * loader of its own with a different LWJGL, and it is brought up later, from
 * the game's own client side, once there is a window to draw into.
 *
 * @see net.vulkanmodnext.VulkanLoader for how the other half is reached
 * @see net.vulkanmodnext.VulkanBridge for the whole of what the two halves share
