/**
 * Acceleration structures over the terrain this renderer already owns.
 *
 * <h2>What this is for, and how it got here</h2>
 *
 * These are traced against every frame: the terrain shader asks them whether
 * anything stands between a surface and the sun, and since August whether
 * anything creature-shaped does.
 *
 * They were built before anything read them, and deliberately. The roadmap had
 * carried one sentence about ray tracing for weeks — that the structure has to
 * be rebuilt whenever a chunk is, and that rebuilding chunks is already the
 * largest cost in a moving frame — and it had never been a number. Writing the
 * shader first would have meant finding out afterwards whether the thing it
 * read could be maintained at all. So this built them, kept them, and reported
 * what they cost, and the answer decided that there was a shader worth
 * writing.
 *
 * <h2>How it maps onto what already exists</h2>
 *
 * It maps unusually well, which is the reason to try. Chunk geometry is already
 * one device-local buffer of quads with a shared triangle index buffer beside
 * it, and vertices are already chunk-local with the chunk's position supplied
 * separately — which is exactly the shape an acceleration structure wants: one
 * structure per chunk in its own coordinates, and one instance per chunk
 * carrying the translation. The position is the first twelve bytes of each
 * twenty-eight byte vertex, so no repacking is needed either.
 *
 * <h2>Bounded on purpose</h2>
 *
 * Only chunks near the camera get a structure, and only a few are built per
 * frame. Both limits exist because the alternative is unbounded: a world at
 * render distance sixty-four is tens of thousands of chunks, and a structure
 * for each would cost more memory than the geometry it describes. Anything a
 * traced ray is going to be believed about — a shadow, a contact reflection —
 * is near the camera anyway.
