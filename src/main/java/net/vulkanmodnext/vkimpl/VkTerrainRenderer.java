     * shader can only take that average by tracing more rays — which multiplies
     * the cost of the one thing in this renderer that is already the expensive
     * part. Spreading the samples over time instead costs one extra fullscreen
     * pass, total, however many frames are averaged.
     *
     * <h2>The two halves, and that neither works alone</h2>
     *
     * The terrain shader turns its dither pattern by a different amount each
     * frame, so successive frames trace *different* rays; this pass finds where
     * each pixel was last frame and mixes what was there into what is here. Put
     * one in without the other and it is strictly worse than doing nothing: a
     * turning pattern with no averaging is a crawling shadow edge, and averaging
     * a pattern that does not turn averages a hundred copies of one answer.
     *
     * <h2>What keeps it from smearing the world</h2>
     *
     * Three things, in order of how much they matter. The history is clamped
     * into the range of the nine pixels around this one, so a pixel that has
     * genuinely changed cannot keep showing what used to be there — this is what
     * makes it safe without a depth test. Reprojection off the edge of the
     * screen, or onto sky, takes no history at all. And the weight falls away
     * with how fast the pixel is moving across the screen, because history
     * resampled through a bilinear filter every frame is history slowly turning
     * to blur, and standing still — where a moving camera is not hiding the
     * grain anyway — is exactly the case worth the most.

     * lava and are not lights.

     * is no terrain, so that the sky shows through, and a glow that stopped at
