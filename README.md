## Get it

| | |
|---|---|
| **[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vulkanmod-next)** | the published build |
| **[Releases](https://github.com/VLOD-ZDOV/VulkanMod-Next/releases)** | the same jars, and the alphas that go out ahead of them |

Everything below describes the **1.12.2** build — the one that works today and the one worth
installing. Work on it carries on; it is not a final version, and the alphas are where it
goes first.

**You also need [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixinbooter) 10.7
or newer in your mods folder.** No launcher installs it for you, and without it the game
stops during coremod discovery on `ClassNotFoundException: zone.rong.mixinbooter.IEarlyMixinLoader`.

---

## What it is

The game still owns the window and the OpenGL context. This mod mirrors vanilla's chunk
geometry into Vulkan, draws the world's blocks and its creatures there, and hands the colour
and the depth back into the game's own frame through shared GPU memory — so both halves line
up, and everything this mod does not draw is drawn exactly as it always was.

If Vulkan is missing, the driver is old, or the two graphics cards in a laptop disagree, the
game renders the way it always did and the log says why.

**Named after VulkanMod, and not a port of it.**
[VulkanMod](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod) is a Fabric mod for 1.17 and later that
replaces the game's renderer outright. This one is written for Forge 1.12.2, leaves the game
holding its window and its OpenGL context, and draws the terrain in Vulkan beside it. **No code
is shared between the two.** What was taken is the idea, and a reading of that project's public
release notes: where a fault it had fixed could exist here too, this code was checked for it
rather than copied from theirs.

---

## What you get

**More frames**, most of all at high render distances and on ordinary screens. The savings are
in work the game does per chunk rather than per pixel, so they grow with the distance and
shrink as the window grows: at 1080p and thirty-two chunks this draws about five times the
game's own rate, at 4K about three and a half.
→ [the numbers, at four screen sizes](BENCHMARKS.md) · [what shipped when](ROADMAP.md#done)

**Effects with a slider each.** Waves, reflections, refraction, bloom, occlusion, swaying
grass, god rays, ray-traced shadows, a round sun and moon. Every one off by default, and
every one a row in a menu rather than a zip to load — turning one on costs a frame, not a
recompile. → [the full list](ADVANCED.md#what-it-draws-in-full)

**Dynamic lights.** A torch in your hand lights the world. So does one you dropped, and a
mob that is on fire. No chunk is rebuilt for it.

**The settings 1.12.2 never gave you.** Entity draw distance, animated-texture control, a
background framerate cap, render distance to 64 chunks, hold-to-zoom.
→ [all of them](ADVANCED.md#settings-that-are-not-effects)

**It steps aside rather than fighting.** Another renderer in the folder, a driver without an
extension, a model built some way this mod does not understand — each one is a fallback, not
a crash. → [when a pack fights back](ADVANCED.md#when-a-pack-fights-back)

Open the menu at **Options → Video Settings → VulkanModNext Settings…**, or press **F6**.
Every row states what it costs on your processor, your graphics card and in video memory
separately, because which of the three you are short of decides whether a setting helps you
at all. Five presets do the choosing if you would rather not: **Stable**, **Beautiful**,
**Balanced**, **Performance**, **Potato**.

## Where it is known to run

|              | Windows | Linux | macOS |
|--------------|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **NVIDIA**   | ✅ run  | ✅ run | ❌ |
| **AMD**      | ✅ run  | ✅ run | ❌ |
| **Intel**    | ⚠️ untried | ⚠️ untried | ❌ |

✅ run — exercised deliberately, not assumed. AMD and NVIDIA are **not the same path**: where
a card cannot hand its depth back in the format the game keeps, this mod hands it over through
a shader instead. That second path is easy to get wrong and hard to notice, so it is tested on
purpose rather than hoped for.

⚠️ untried — no reason it should not work, nobody has reported either way. If you are on one,
a bug report with the diagnostics file is genuinely useful.

❌ — macOS has no Vulkan driver of its own and is out of scope.

## Other optimisation mods

| | | |
|---|:---:|---|
| **Phosphor**, **Alfheim** | 🟢 | Lighting engines. They work on the world, this works on the picture. Keep them. |
| **FoamFix**, **LoliASM / CensoredASM** | 🟢 | Memory. Nothing in common with this. |
| **VintageFix** | 🟢 | Resource and model loading, before a frame is ever drawn. |
| **BetterFps**, **Clumps**, **FastFurnace**, **AI Improvements**, **RandomPatches** | 🟢 | Server-side and tick-side work. Untouched by any of this. |
| **Particle Culling**, **Chunk Pregenerator**, **RoughlyEnoughIDs** | 🟢 | Run alongside; all three are in the pack below. |
| **OptiFine** | 🟡 | Replaces the same part of the game. The Vulkan renderer does not load; its settings and speed options stay. |
| **Shaders Mod** (the old GLSL one) | 🟡 | Same as OptiFine, same outcome. |
| **Celeritas**, **Actinium** | 🟡 | Sodium ports — a second terrain renderer. This one steps aside. |
| **Nothirium** | 🟡 | Rewrites the chunk rendering engine. This one steps aside. |
| **Vintagium**, **Relictium**, **Neonium** | 🟡 | A Sodium port and two forks of it. Same story, same outcome. |
| **Vulcanizator** | 🟡 | A second Vulkan renderer, and it takes over presentation as well. This one steps aside. |
| anything else | 🔴 | **None known.** No mod has yet been found that cannot be in the folder at all. |
| **All the Mods 3 Remix** — around **340 mods** | 🟢 | Loads, draws its world through this renderer, on the Beautiful preset with every effect on. Confirmed, not assumed. |

🟢 runs alongside, nothing to do · 🟡 the Vulkan renderer stands aside and the rest of the mod
stays · 🔴 cannot be installed together

Standing aside is automatic and silent. You keep the settings screen, the draw distances, the
background cap, the zoom and every speed option — you just do not get the Vulkan terrain,
because two renderers cannot own the world between them. One this build has not heard of can
be named by hand in `config/vulkanmodnext-standaside.txt`.

---

## Requirements

- Minecraft **1.12.2** with Forge 14.23.5.2857 or compatible, or **Cleanroom** — both tested
- **MixinBooter 10.7 or newer**, installed by hand
- A 64-bit **Vulkan driver** on Windows or Linux
- For the terrain path, matching external-memory and semaphore extensions on both sides:
  `GL_EXT_memory_object_fd` / `GL_EXT_semaphore_fd` with `VK_KHR_external_memory_fd` /
  `VK_KHR_external_semaphore_fd` on Linux, and the `_win32` variants of the same four on
  Windows. The right pair is chosen for the host automatically; without them the mod loads
  safely and leaves terrain to OpenGL.
- One graphics card doing both halves. On a machine with two, the mod compares device UUIDs
  at startup and stays on vanilla rendering if they differ, naming both in the log.

---

## Honest limits

This is not a drop-in OptiFine replacement, and it is not finished.

- **Not every effect reaches everything.** The ones that run over the finished picture —
  occlusion, contact and cloud shadows, god rays, grading — reach creatures, particles and
  other mods' content for free. The rest are worked out while the blocks are drawn and stop
  there: a burning creeper does not glow, because what glows is recorded per block while a
  chunk is built and a creeper is not a block.
- **A mod that builds its creatures with its own drawing code** rather than out of the game's
  model parts is left to the game, as are chests, signs and machines.
- **Screen reflections reflect what is on the screen** — nothing off the edge of the frame,
  nothing hidden behind something nearer. Treat this one as unfinished.
- **Chunk building dominates the frame while you move** at high render distances. Standing
  still is much faster than turning, and that is the game's own work rather than this mod's.
- **No connected textures, and no shader pack support.**

---

## Something looks wrong

**Send one file: `logs/latest.log`.** Play for about a minute with the world visible first;
that is the whole of the preparation.

A picture that comes out wrong has a handful of causes that look identical on screen — the
world never arrived, a copy the driver refused, a pass that stood down, an effect that graded
it away. So the renderer reads back a pixel of its own frame at three points and writes what
it found, in plain numbers, into that file, unasked and whatever the settings are. Those
numbers separate all four before anyone has to ask you anything.

Going further is optional: turn on **Ultra Logging** and send
`logs/vulkanmodnext-diagnostics.log` as well. → [what else is in there](ADVANCED.md#diagnostics)

## The 1.16.5 build

In this repository under `1.16.5/`, and attached to the
[releases](https://github.com/VLOD-ZDOV/VulkanMod-Next/releases) from 0.10.0-alpha.7 as
`vulkanmodnext-1.16.5-<version>.jar`. It needs Forge 36 and nothing else — no MixinBooter, and
the Vulkan bindings the game does not ship are inside the jar.

It is an alpha, and a younger one than the 1.12.2 build. What it does:

- the terrain, water, creatures, particles, rain and snow are drawn by Vulkan, on by default;
- the effects and presets of the 1.12.2 build, with the same names and the same values;
- the 1.12.2 build's settings for the game itself — fog, time and weather, zoom, frame graph,
  render distance past 32, chunk build threads — and the CPU savings that apply to this
  version's engine.

The settings screen says, setting by setting, which ones act on this version. 85 of the
1.12.2 build's 106 do; each was shown working by turning it to both ends on the same route and
comparing the two frames, and the ones that could not be shown that way are greyed and say so.

What it cannot do: **ray tracing**, nor the settings built on it. The Vulkan bindings this
version of the game ships are older than ray tracing in Vulkan, and they are the ones the game
loads. The menu says "not on 1.16.5" rather than "not yet".

What is worse than on 1.12.2: a mod whose patches collide with this one's stops the game at
startup. The 1.12.2 build switches the colliding part off and carries on; this one does not
yet. If that happens to you, the log names the patch — please report it.

Two things about it are better than the 1.12.2 build, and both come from the version rather
than from us: the game is on LWJGL 3 already, so the whole two-class-loader construction is
gone, and a 1.16.5 vertex carries its own normal.
