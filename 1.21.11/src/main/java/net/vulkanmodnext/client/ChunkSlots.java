/**
 * Hands every mirrored VertexBuffer a small dense index of its own.
 *
 * The mirror used to be keyed by the buffer's GL name, which forced a hash
 * table: GL names are assigned by the driver, are not dense, and at render
 * distance 64 there are hundreds of thousands of them. Every chunk of every
 * drawn layer cost a lookup that landed somewhere unrelated in memory.
 *
 * A slot is dense by construction, so the mirror can be a plain array and the
 * lookup becomes an index. Slots are recycled when a buffer is deleted, which
 * keeps the array roughly the size of the live chunk grid instead of growing
 * with every rebuild the session has ever done.
 *
 * Keyed on the VertexBuffer rather than on the GL name for a second reason:
 * the object exists from the moment the chunk is created, while the GL name
 * only exists once the render thread uploads. That is what will let the mirror
 * copy move off the render thread later.
