/**
 * Reads the finished frame back and says what is in it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this and not a look at the screen</h2>
 *
 * "The renderer ran without errors" and "the world is on the screen" are
 * different claims, and the first one is easy to mistake for the second. Every
 * stage of the Vulkan path can report success while drawing nothing: the frame
 * is recorded, submitted, composited, and what lands is the colour it was
 * cleared to.
 *
 * <p>So the frame is read back and described by two numbers that a blank one
 * cannot fake: how many distinct colours are in it, and how much of it is not
 * the single most common colour. A sky-and-nothing frame is two or three
 * colours and almost entirely one of them. A drawn world is thousands.
 *
 * <p>The point of printing them is comparison: the same route with the terrain
 * switch on and off should give two similar readings. One number alone proves
 * nothing, which is why the line says which run it came from.
