/**
 * The matrix arithmetic that stands between OpenGL's conventions and Vulkan's.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is its own class</h2>
 *
 * This was four loops inside {@code TerrainHooks}, which imports the game and
 * holds a frame's worth of state, so none of it could be run without a client.
 * That matters more here than the size of the code suggests: every number the
 * terrain shader places in the world comes through these lines, an error in
 * them looks like a plausible picture drawn slightly wrong, and this project
 * has twice spent a day on arithmetic that read correctly — a refraction
 * offset that was inverted and a depth range that was not.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here touches OpenGL, Vulkan or Minecraft. That is the point: it
 * can be checked against known answers rather than against a screenshot.
 *
 * <h2>Column-major</h2>
 *
 * OpenGL hands back matrices in column-major order and so does everything
 * here: element {@code m[col * 4 + row]}. Vulkan's shaders read the same
 * layout, so the arrays are passed through untouched apart from what is
 * documented below.
