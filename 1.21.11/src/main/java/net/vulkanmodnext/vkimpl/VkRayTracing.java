/**
 * The shape of ray tracing, with none of it behind the shape.
 *
 * <h2>Why a class that does nothing is better than deleting the calls</h2>
 *
 * The terrain renderer arrived from 1.12.2 with ray tracing woven through it:
 * where the acceleration structure is rebuilt, which frame it belongs to, how
 * the creature geometry is handed over, what the buffer needs on top of being a
 * vertex buffer. That is a great deal of hard-won placement, and none of it can
 * run here — the bindings the game brings are older than Vulkan 1.2 and know
 * nothing of {@code KHR_acceleration_structure}.
 *
 * <p>Two ways to deal with that. Cut the calls out, and the placement is lost:
 * whoever brings ray tracing to this version has to find every one of those
 * spots again, and the ones they miss are the ones that fail quietly. Or keep
 * the calls and make the object they are talking to do nothing — which is what
 * this is.
 *
 * <p>It is never constructed. The renderer only builds one when ray tracing is
 * enabled, and {@code VkContext} cannot enable it. So this costs a class file
 * and buys the map back.
 *
 * <p>What it deliberately does <b>not</b> do is pretend. Nothing here returns a
 * plausible-looking handle or a comforting boolean: {@link #topLevel} answers
 * zero, {@link #creaturesInStructure} answers false, and the diagnostics say in
 * words that this version has no ray tracing rather than printing an empty
 * section. A stub that answers agreeably is how a missing feature gets reported
 * as a broken one.
