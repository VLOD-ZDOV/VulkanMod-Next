/**
 * How a chunk's vertices are laid out in video memory, and the packing that
 * gets them there.
 *
 * <h2>Why pack at all</h2>
 *
 * The terrain pass was measured against render distance and against window
 * size, and the two answers together name what it is waiting for: **0.048 ms
 * per million vertices, and flat in pixels** — 0.44 ms at 0.9 megapixels
 * against 0.50 at 7.6. Nine million vertices at twenty-eight bytes is 252 MB
 * of vertex fetch a frame, which at the measured 0.43 ms is about 580 GB/s.
 * That is the card's memory bandwidth. The pass is not filling pixels or
 * running out of shader; it is reading vertices.
 *
 * <h2>The layout</h2>
 *
 * Vanilla's is twenty-eight bytes and this mod mirrors it byte for byte, which
 * is the reason the mod never has to understand geometry it did not build. The
 * packed one is sixteen:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   0  position x, y, z   3 x int16   1/2048 of a block, from the section's middle
 *   6  both light values  1 x int16   one byte each, side by side
 *   8  colour             4 x uint8   unchanged
 *  12  texture u, v       2 x uint16  normalised, and vanilla's are already 0..1
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>What each field gives up, and what it does not</h2>
 *
 * <b>Position</b> keeps 1/2048 of a block. Vanilla's own models are built on a
 * sixteenth of a block and its textures are sixteen pixels across one, so this
 * is a hundred and twenty-eight times finer than a texel. It is measured from
 * the middle of the section rather than its corner, which puts the sixteen
 * blocks of headroom evenly on both sides — a model that hangs out of its own
 * section has room in either direction. The scale is a power of two and the
 * sections sit on a sixteen-block grid, so a face shared by two chunks lands on
 * exactly the same lattice point from both sides: no cracks, no z-fighting.
 * The exact span is −8 to +24 blocks with the top end open — a signed short
 * reaches one further down than up — and a vanilla model may hang one block out
 * of its cube, not eight, so nothing goes near either end. Both statements are
 * asserted in {@code VertexPackingTest} rather than left here to be believed.
 *
 * <b>Light</b> is exact. The game writes the two lightmap coordinates as shorts
 * but never above 240 — they are a light level times sixteen, and smooth
 * lighting averages them, which cannot leave the range — so a byte holds every
 * value they can take. Anything that arrives above a byte is counted and
 * clamped rather than silently wrapped.
 *
 * <b>Texture coordinates</b> are the one field that can actually lose
 * something. Sixteen bits normalised is one part in 65 535 of the whole atlas,
 * which on a 4096-pixel atlas is a sixteenth of a texel and on a 16 384-pixel
 * one is a quarter of it. A quarter of a texel at a sprite's edge is enough to
 * fetch the neighbouring sprite once mipmaps are involved. So the atlas is
 * checked, and a large one keeps the wide layout.
 *
 * <b>Colour</b> is untouched: it carries the ambient occlusion as well as the
 * biome tint, and anything narrower than a byte a channel bands visibly on a
 * smoothly lit wall.
 *
 * <h2>Why not smaller than sixteen</h2>
 *
 * Ten bits an axis would make the position four bytes and the vertex twelve,
 * but ten bits over the same span is 1/43 of a block — coarser than the
 * sixteenth vanilla models are built on, which is where two quads that should
 * share an edge stop sharing it. Everything else is already at its floor: the
 * colour bands if narrowed, the light is exactly a byte, and the texture
 * coordinates are the field that is already the tightest of the four. Sixteen
 * is where the next byte costs picture rather than bandwidth.

     * away from wherever you stand, and the card throws those away — but only

     *
     * A camera standing above a chunk cannot see one of that chunk's
     * downward-facing quads, and one standing below cannot see an upward-facing
     * one. The card already knows this and throws those triangles away — but
     * only after the vertex shader has run, which means every one of their
     * vertices was fetched first, and fetching is exactly what this pass is
     * bound by: 0.32 ms of fixed cost against 0.0095 ms per megapixel. Sorted
     * this way, the draw can simply stop short of the down group or start after
     * it, and the vertices are never read.
     *
     * <h2>Why three groups and not seven</h2>
     *
     * Six would let a camera skip about 43% of a chunk rather than the 22% or
     * 29% here — but it takes four draw commands per chunk-layer where this
     * takes one, because the visible groups are not adjacent. Four commands is
     * around 0.1 ms a frame of extra writing on the render thread, and the
     * processor and the card in this renderer are 0.85 ms against 0.95: a
     * change that takes 0.15 ms off the card and puts 0.1 ms on the processor
     * moves the ceiling rather than lowering it. Three groups cost the draw
     * side nothing at all.
     *
     * <h2>Why the groups are shelved by height</h2>
     *
     * A single "is the camera above every down-facing quad in this chunk" test
     * was tried and answers for a seventh of the geometry where this answers for
     * a fifth: one overhang near the top of a section makes the answer no for
     * everything below it, and the ground and the camera are usually inside the
     * same sixteen-block band anyway. Sorting each group by the block level it
     * sits on turns one conservative answer into seventeen exact ones, and lets
     * both ends of the range be trimmed in the same frame — the quads under the
     * camera and the ones over it are different quads.
