/**
 * Asks, once, whether there is a Vulkan driver reachable from inside the game.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists before anything else</h2>
 *
 * The port rests on one assumption that no amount of reading can settle: that
 * the LWJGL the game has already started — version 3.3.3, its own, loaded by
 * its own loader, with the game's natives — can reach a Vulkan driver when
 * handed nothing but the bindings jar. On 1.12.2 it could not, and the whole
 * two-classloader construction exists because of it. On 1.16.5 it could, and
 * this is the check that said so.
 *
 * <p>So this is the first thing written and the first thing run. It creates an
 * instance, counts the cards and says what it found, and it is written to fail
 * with a sentence rather than a stack trace: "no driver" and "the bindings did
 * not load" need opposite fixes, and a caught throwable that says neither is
 * how a week goes missing.
