 * WHY_NOT_WITH_RAY_QUERY
 *
 * Two effects below — the shine on ice and the caustics on a riverbed — are

 *
 * The translucent pipeline is the one with no room left in it. It carries an
 * unconditional shadow ray per fragment, up to eight more towards moving
 * lights, and a marched reflection of up to forty dependent samples. All of
 * that is latency-bound work, which does not scale with how much arithmetic is
 * added to it — it scales with how many waves the card can keep in flight to
 * hide the waiting, and that is decided by registers.
 *
 * This was measured, once, expensively. A specular glint on water — a
 * normalize, a dot and a pow, under ten operations — was added, and the card
 * was lost outright (Xid 109, a context switch timeout) reproducibly, over
 * open water, with tracing on. Three arms of the experiment: tracing and
 * glint together lost the device, tracing alone was clean, glint alone was
 * clean. The one measured fact was that the glint grew this shader's tracing
 * variant by 7.4%.
 *
 * Both effects here are translucent-only, so gating them on BLEND would not
 * help — the translucent pipeline is exactly where they would land. Compiled
 * out of the tracing variant, they cost that pipeline nothing at all, and the
 * settings screen says out loud that they are switched on and inert when rays
 * are being traced. See SettingsHealth on the game side.
 *
 * What would let them back in is not a smaller version of them: it is making
 * the water branch itself cheaper, at which point this can be measured again.

 *
 * What it reflects is the game's own fog colour. That is not a shortcut

 * shows you *is* the horizon, and the horizon is exactly what the fog colour
 * is — vanilla's own, read from GL each frame, so it tracks sunrise, weather,
 * being underwater and whatever a mod has done to it. Reflecting anything

 * Follows a reflected ray across the picture that is already drawn.
 *
 * The whole of this rests on one accident of the frame's order. Water is drawn
 * in a pass of its own, after the opaque world has been finished and handed
 * back — so by the time a water fragment is being shaded, the colour and depth
 * of everything behind it exist and can be read. Nothing has to be traced
 * against the world itself, which is what makes this cost a loop rather than an
 * acceleration structure.
 *
 * The ray is walked in the same space the fragment is in, camera-relative
 * world, and each step is put back on screen with the frame's own matrix. That
 * is not a shortcut for a screen-space walk, it is the accurate version of it:
 * equal steps on screen are wildly unequal steps in the world, and it is the
 * world the ray is travelling through. Steps grow as they go, because a metre
 * near the eye covers far more of the screen than a metre far from it.
 *
 * What comes back is a colour and how much to believe it. The honest part is
 * the believing: this can only ever reflect what is on the screen, so a ray
 * that leaves the frame, or turns back towards the eye where nothing can be
 * behind it, has no answer and says so rather than inventing one. The caller
 * falls back to the fog colour, which is the horizon, which is what flat water
 * shows at that angle anyway.

 * The march walked from the water towards the sun and asked the depth buffer,

 * buffer records a surface and not a solid, so that question has no answer:
 * every ray that clears the far bank passes behind the far bank on its way
 * up, and "went into it" and "went over it" look identical. Neighbouring

 * all of its glint, the other loses all of it — and the result was a field of
 * dots in an ordered grid with a hard edge, sitting in the middle of the
 * sun's own reflection.
 *
 * Five things were tried against a fixed camera, a fixed hour and a frozen
 * clock: a thickness slab, a cap on that slab, the share of the march that
 * was blocked rather than the first hit, a near-field march of eight blocks,
 * and a lower ramp clear of rounding. Every one of them left the speckle;
 * removing the march left a clean highlight and nothing else changed.
 *
 * The price is that the glint can appear on water the sun cannot actually

        // What it is told is the block's own light level, decided where the
        // chunk was built and carried in the material byte. Two earlier
        // versions guessed instead and both were wrong in the same way: being
        // a light is a fact about a block, and neither of the things a
        // fragment can see is. Judging by the texture's brightness lit the
        // pale texels of a glowstone block and left its dark ones to receive
        // the glow from their neighbours, so a light source came out mottled;
        // and folding in the vertex colour meant vanilla's own face shading
        // decided it, which multiplies the sides of a block by 0.8 and 0.6 and
        // its underside by 0.5 — so a block glowed from its top and two sides
        // and not the other two. Both were reported from a screenshot.
        //
        // And when it is not a light, the alpha carries how much of the sky
        // reaches this surface instead, in the lower half of the range that
        // nothing was using.

        // This is what lets a shadow drawn over the finished frame behave like
        // the traced one. The traced shadow lowers sky light and leaves block
        // light alone, so a cave wall lit by a torch is not darkened by the
        // sun — the screen-space shadows could not do that, because by the
        // time the frame exists the two halves of the light have been
        // multiplied into one colour and nothing downstream can tell them
        // apart. The share is known exactly here and only here.
        //
        // Written after the traced shadow rather than before it, which also
        // settles the third disagreement: a surface the ray already put in
        // shadow arrives with its sky light lowered, so the screen-space
        // shadow has little left to take. The two stop compounding without
        // either of them being told about the other.
        //
        // A light keeps the old meaning and gives up the sky share, which
        // costs nothing worth having: a glowstone block is not a surface
        // anybody looks at for a shadow. The floor of 0.006 is the composite's
