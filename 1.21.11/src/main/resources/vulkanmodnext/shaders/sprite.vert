#version 450

// Everything the game draws as camera-facing textured quads: particles, rain
// and snow. One pipeline for all of it, because they are the same shape of
// work — a list of quads in camera-relative coordinates, one texture at a
// time, blended over the world.
//
// Only the first three members of the frame block are declared. The buffer is
// the terrain's and it is much longer than this; a shader may read the front
// of a uniform block and ignore the rest, and repeating twenty fields nobody
// here looks at would be a second place for the layout to drift out of step.

// different order, which is why it needs its own attribute description and
// not its own upload path.

// second pipeline for the sake of one vector.
