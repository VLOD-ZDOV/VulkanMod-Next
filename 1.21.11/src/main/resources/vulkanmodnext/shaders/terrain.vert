 * than a pixel, and how many pixels a blade of grass covers is a question about
 * the projection, not about the distance. Asking it this way means the zoom key
 * needs no special case at all — narrowing the field of view enlarges
 * everything, so grass that had stopped moving starts again exactly where it
 * becomes visible, and nothing here has to know that a zoom exists.
 *
 * The vertical scale is read out of the combined matrix rather than passed in:
 * the matrix is a projection times a rotation and a translation, so its second
 * column of the upper three-by-three is that scale times a row of the rotation,
 * and a rotation's rows are unit length.
 *
 * The four corners of one quad get slightly different answers, because their
 * distances differ. Over one block that difference is a thousandth of the band,
 * against an amplitude that is by then about a pixel — far below what a seam
 * would need to open by. Fading per chunk instead would be exactly constant
 * within a quad and would put a step between neighbouring chunks, which is the
 * visible failure rather than the invisible one.
