# Benchmarks

Numbers for this mod against the game's own renderer and against the other 1.12.2 renderer
replacements, measured rather than estimated, with the method written down so that anybody
can disagree with the result by running it.

Every number here is a frame rate from the same fixed route through the same fixed world.
**The effects this mod adds are switched off for all of it.** They are optional, they are off
by default, and leaving them on would be measuring the effects rather than the renderer.

---

## Method

The mod can fly itself. `-Pflight=<route>` makes the game create a world from a fixed seed,
wait for it to settle, fly a fixed route at a fixed speed, and quit. Nobody sits and flies it,
so two runs differ by what is being measured rather than by how the mouse was moved.

**The number is the game's own frame counter**, the one in the corner of the debug screen,
read once a second for the twenty seconds of the route, and reported as the median. It has to
be the game's: this mod's own diagnostics are better and cannot compare renderers at all,
because when another renderer is in the folder this mod stands aside and takes its diagnostics
with it. A counter that belongs to the game is there whoever is drawing, and that is the only
thing that makes one row of the table below mean the same as the row above it.

Pinned for every run: the world seed, the route, the render distance, the time of day, the
weather, the settings preset, the length of the flight, and **the size of the window** — which
turned out to matter more than any of the others, and is why the table has four columns
instead of one number.

Verified rather than assumed:

- **No frame cap of any kind.** Vertical sync is off, and the game's frame limit is at the
  setting it calls "unlimited". The rows that look flat are flat because of what limits them,
  not because something is holding them there — and the giveaway is the spread: a capped run
  sits on one number, and the flattest row here still wanders by eight per cent from second to
  second.
- **The world is warm.** The route keeps its world between runs, so the terrain is already on
  disk. The first run of a seed is generating rather than drawing, and before this was
  understood two runs of an identical build differed by forty per cent.
- **The medians are stable.** Every row was measured twice at 1920 × 1080, on separate runs.
  The two agree within four per cent, which is the noise floor of this measurement.
- **The machine belonged to the measurement**, from now on by record rather than by assumption.
  A sampler alongside the flight writes down, once a second, what share of the processor and of
  the graphics card went to anything that was not the game, together with the card's clock and
  whether it was being held back; a run that did not have the machine to itself is discarded
  rather than explained. This was added after two runs of an identical build disagreed by
  seventy-four per cent and the cause turned out to be a second program holding half the
  processor and half the card's memory. The rows below predate it, and the case for them is the
  one above: each was flown twice and the pair agreed within four per cent.

## The table

Frames per second along the same route, at render distance 32, at four window sizes. Higher is
better.

| | 1280 × 720 | 1920 × 1080 | 2560 × 1440 | 3840 × 2160 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The game's own renderer | 163 | 165 | 163 | 152 |
| **This mod** | **953** | 855 | 734 | 532 |
| **This mod, everything on** | **1128** | **972** | 797 | 564 |
| **This mod, with facing groups** | **1231** | **1059** | **856** | 576 |
| Nothirium | 865 | 855 | 822 | 565 |
| Relictium | 659 | 656 | 659 | **646** |

The first four rows are all this mod; they differ only in settings, and they are kept apart
because that is what says how much of the gain is a switch and how much is the renderer.
"Everything on" is packed chunk vertices and the short layer filter list. The last of the four
adds quad facing groups, and **all three of those are the default now**, so the fourth row is
the one to read for a fresh install.

That fourth row was measured in a later session, so it comes with its own control: the same
build with facing groups switched off, run alongside it in the same session, at 1087 / 944 / 770
/ 547. That control sits two to four per cent under the row above it, which is the machine
rather than the code and inside the noise floor this table already declares. What the paired
runs measured is **+13.3% / +12.2% / +11.2% / +5.4%**, and the shape of that is the same
statement the rest of the table makes: the saving is vertices never read, so it is worth most
where the frame is short and least where a screen's worth of pixels is what the frame is
spending its time on.

Against the game's own renderer:

| | 1280 × 720 | 1920 × 1080 | 2560 × 1440 | 3840 × 2160 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **This mod** | **5.8x** | **5.2x** | **4.5x** | **3.5x** |
| **This mod, everything on** | **6.9x** | **5.9x** | **4.9x** | **3.7x** |
| **This mod, with facing groups** | **7.6x** | **6.4x** | **5.3x** | **3.8x** |
| Nothirium | 5.3x | 5.2x | 5.0x | 3.7x |
| Relictium | 4.0x | 4.0x | 4.0x | 4.3x |

## Reading it honestly

**There is no fastest renderer here. There is a fastest renderer for your screen.**

That is the whole finding, and it is not what a single-column table can say. Each of these four
is held back by something different, and what holds it back decides how it answers a bigger
window:

- **The game's own renderer is bound by how many separate draws it makes.** Eight times the
  pixels costs it seven per cent. It is doing thousands of draw calls and the card is idle
  between them; the screen size barely reaches it.
- **Relictium is bound by the processor**, at four times the game's rate and just as flat.
  Eight times the pixels costs it two per cent. It is a port of Sodium, and Sodium is very
  careful about what it asks the card to do.
- **Nothirium is flat until 1440 and then is not.** It holds 865 to 822 across the first three
  columns and falls to 565 at 4K, which is where it starts paying for pixels like this mod does.
- **This mod is bound by pixels from the start.** Eight times the pixels costs it 1.8 times the
  frame rate. It composites a full screen of colour and hands a full screen of depth across
  twice a frame, and none of the other three do any of that.

So: **at 1280 × 720 this mod is the fastest thing in the table, by a third. At 3840 × 2160 it
is the slowest of the three replacements.** Both of those are the same fact seen from two ends,
and neither is worth stating without the other.

Facing groups moved the middle of that sentence. At 2560 × 1440 this mod is now ahead of
Nothirium rather than nine per cent behind it — 856 against 822 — and at 3840 × 2160 the two are
level, 576 against 565, where it used to be the one place a replacement clearly beat this one.
Relictium still wins 4K by a tenth, and for the reason the shapes give: it is not spending its
frame on pixels, and this mod is. Nothing about geometry left unread touches a screen's worth of
colour composited and a screen's worth of depth handed across, and that is what is left.

**Below about eighteen chunks of render distance the game's own renderer is still faster than
this one**, whatever the window. This mod trades a cost per chunk for a cost per pixel, and at
a short distance there are not enough chunks for the trade to pay.

**If frames are the only thing you want**, the honest recommendation depends on the screen:
Relictium above 1440, this mod below it, and Nothirium is a good answer anywhere. Neither of
the other two draws water with waves or a sun that glints off it, and it costs nothing to say
so.

## What the passes over the finished frame cost

Timed on the card rather than inferred from a frame rate, which is a distinction this table has
had to make before: on a machine where the card is the ceiling, switching an effect off and
watching the frame rate answers a different question than the one being asked.

At 1920 × 1080 with every effect on:

| Pass | On the card |
|---|---|
| Occlusion, and the light shafts inside it | 0.10 ms |
| Glow | 0.10 ms |
| Grading — tone, exposure, gamma, colour vision | 0.03 ms |
| Handing the frame to OpenGL | 0.05 ms |

Some 0.28 ms in total, against a frame of about 0.95 ms at that size. The instrument was then
measured against itself over four interleaved runs and costs at most half a per cent, which is
the noise floor of a stationary measurement — so the numbers above are the passes and not the
timing of them.

---

## What changed while this was being measured

Measuring produced a fix rather than only a table.

Standing still at 32 chunks this mod was within fifteen per cent of the fastest thing in the
table. Flying the same route it dropped to half. The gap was not in drawing: this renderer's
own work is 0.3 ms of a 4 ms frame, and the card is idle. It was in deciding *which chunks are
on screen* — a walk over the visible set that is redone whenever the answer might have changed.

The measurement, on one interval of one flight: the walk was armed **1 201 010 times**, every
one of them by a chunk finishing its build rather than by the view moving, and it ran on
**1762 frames out of 1762** at about 1.4 ms each. A third of the render thread, spent rebuilding
an answer that had changed by one chunk.

The view is now answered at once and a finished chunk at a tick's pace. Same route, same world:

| At 32 chunks, flying | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Deciding what is on screen | 1.74–1.88 ms/frame | 0.31–0.46 ms/frame |
| Frame rate, second half of route | 216–273 | 343–441 |

The frames taken at the same points before and after are the same picture. Standing still is
unchanged, which is the point: the cost was never there.

---

## The pass that was not about creatures

The second thing measuring produced, and the larger one.

`renderEntities` sounds like a loop over creatures. It is a loop over **every section on
screen**: for each one it asks the world which chunk that section belongs to, and only then
whether anything is standing in it. At thirty-two chunks that is some 17 700 sections, of
which about 2 700 contain any blocks at all — the rest is open air, walked twice a frame.

The proof is a render-distance sweep with the scene held still. Five creatures drawn at every
distance, nothing else changed:

| Render distance | `renderEntities` | of it, block entities | creatures drawn |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 chunks | 0.07 ms | 0.01 | 5 |
| 16 chunks | 0.38 ms | 0.08 | 5 |
| 32 chunks | **1.10 ms** | **0.36** | 5 |

The creature count never moves and the cost grows sixteenfold. The block-entity column is the
cleanest part of it: 0.01 ms to 0.36 with **zero block entities drawn anywhere**. Nothing is
being rendered there. That is the walk, and only the walk.

So the loop is turned inside out. There are sixty entities in that world and seventeen
thousand sections; each entity already records the section it is filed under, and this mod's
visibility search already knows in one array read whether a section is on screen. The sections
that can hold something are handed to the game, in the order it would have visited them, and
the game finds exactly the same creatures in them. The block-entity list is gathered while the
search walks, and topped up when a chunk finishes building with a chest in it.

Same route, same world, one session, the change switched on and off:

| At 32 chunks, flying | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `renderEntities` | 1.12 ms/frame | **0.01 ms/frame** |
| of it, block entities | 0.37 ms | 0.00 ms |
| Frame rate along the route | 305–354 | **512–513** |
| Worst frame on the route | 225 | **353** |

At 24 chunks it gains one per cent and at 8 chunks nothing at all, which is the same statement
from the other side: below thirty-two the frame is not waiting on the thread this saves.

**Neither of the other two replacements pays this cost either**, and it is worth saying so
plainly: this is not something they had missed. Both of them replace the game's own terrain
setup wholesale, so the list this loop walks is simply never filled — Relictium then draws
creatures from its own visible set in the same place, by the same reasoning. The measurement
above is what this mod had to spend to arrive where they already were, not an advantage over
them.

**How it was checked.** A shortcut that quietly drops a creature looks exactly like a creature
that walked off, so the shortened lists are compared against the full scan they replace, entry
by entry, under a switch. It found a real fault the first time it ran — 186 block-entity
sections missing while a world filled in, because a section already on the list can finish
building afterwards — and reports nothing missing at all now, on either list. The frames taken
at the same points on the route differ from each other exactly as much as two runs of the
identical build do, which is animals having wandered.

---

## Why the shape of the table is what it is

The rows above differ because the frame is broken in different places, and the
frame can be taken apart to show where.

It was split into the phases the game names for its own profiler, and then into
what the loop around them does. At thirty-two chunks, drawing the whole world
costs **0.83 ms of a 2.0 ms frame**. Most of the rest is a single thing: the game
asks the driver twice a frame whether anything has gone wrong, and the answer
cannot come back until the card has caught up with the work already handed to
it. That wait is not the question's fault — skipping the question does not gain
a frame, it only moves the wait to the next call that needs the driver — but it
is a clean measure of how far behind the card is, and it tracks the pixel count
and almost nothing else: **0.33 ms at 0.9 megapixels, 0.45 at 2.1, 1.05 at 7.6.**

**So this renderer's frame is about 0.7 ms of processor work plus a tenth of a
millisecond for every megapixel** — which is exactly the curve the second row of
the table draws.

Taken apart further, at 7.6 megapixels the card spends 1.88 ms on the frame:
0.005 on clearing it, 0.46 on this renderer's terrain, 0.13 on handing the
colour and the depth across, 0.034 on copying the finished frame to the window,
and **0.69 on presenting it**. That last one is nobody's code and everybody pays
it — but only a renderer that has already finished its own work waits on it, and
that is why the two flat rows stay flat and this one does not.

---

## What the terrain pass itself is waiting for

The window sweep above answers half the question. The other half is what the
Vulkan pass costs, and it turns out not to be pixels at all:

| Render distance | vertices | the card's time |
|---|---|---|
| 8 chunks | 0.50 M | 0.05 ms |
| 16 chunks | 1.93 M | 0.15 ms |
| 24 chunks | 5.05 M | 0.30 ms |
| 32 chunks | 9.02 M | 0.46 ms |

About 0.048 ms per million vertices, and flat across the window: 0.44 ms at 0.9
megapixels against 0.50 at 7.6. Nine million vertices at the twenty-eight bytes
this mod mirrors from the game is **252 MB of vertex reading a frame**, which at
that time is roughly the card's whole memory bandwidth. The pass is not filling
pixels and not running out of shader — it is reading vertices.

Packing that vertex into sixteen bytes is a setting (**on by default** since the
picture was checked, Advanced → Pack Chunk Vertices). It moves the card's terrain
time to 0.42 ms, and what that
is worth in frames depends on the window in exactly the way everything else here
does — because reading vertices costs the same whatever the screen, so removing
some of it is a bigger share of a shorter frame:

| | 1280 × 720 | 1920 × 1080 | 2560 × 1440 | 3840 × 2160 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Packing the vertex is worth | **+18%** | **+14%** | +9% | +6% |

And it does one thing in full, at every window: **428 MiB of video memory for
this mod's copy of the world becomes 240**. How much of the world fits is what
decides whether a long render distance is possible at all.

---

## Where a frame actually goes, measured from one spot

Everything above is frame rates. This is the same frame taken apart, standing
still at render distance 32 with effects off, so that nothing moves between the
readings. "The card" is the sum of the timer queries OpenGL answers.

| Window | megapixels | the frame | the card |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1280 × 720 | 0.92 | 0.80 ms | 0.78 ms |
| 1920 × 1080 | 2.07 | 0.95 ms | 0.93 ms |
| 2560 × 1440 | 3.69 | 1.17 ms | 1.16 ms |
| 3840 × 2160 | 8.29 | 1.71 ms | 1.71 ms |

**The two columns agree at every size, so the card is what the frame waits for**
— at this render distance, on this machine, at any window. The processor is
never the limit here, and that is worth knowing before believing any claim about
work taken off it: it can be real work, genuinely removed, and buy nothing.

A straight line through those four points gives **0.66 ms of fixed cost plus
0.121 ms per megapixel**. The two halves have different owners:

- **The fixed part is mostly vertices.** 0.43 ms of it is the Vulkan terrain
  pass, and 9.19 M vertices at the measured 0.048 ms per million is 0.44 — the
  same number from the other side.
- **The per-pixel part is almost none of it the terrain pass.** Measured on its
  own, that pass costs 0.33 ms at 720p and 0.40 at 4K: **nine times the pixels
  for a fifth more time.** What does scale is handing the frame over — a
  full-screen composite and the depth going back — and the driver's own present,
  which the game's renderer pays as well.

Two things follow, and they are the reason this section exists rather than a
list of ideas:

- **Rendering the terrain smaller and scaling it up saves almost nothing here.**
  At 4K it would take about 0.06 ms off a 1.71 ms frame before paying for the
  upscale, because resolution is not what this pass is spending. That is the
  answer to "why not FSR or DLSS", and it is a measurement rather than an
  opinion. There is a second reason as well: this mod draws only terrain, and a
  temporal upscaler needs motion vectors for everything in the frame.
- **Fewer vertices is the lever that is left.** Sorting a chunk's faces so a
  camera never reads the ones pointing away from it takes 12.8% off the reading
  and about six per cent off the frame; that is Optimization → Group Quad
  Facings, off while it is new.

### Below the render distance where this mod pays for itself

At **8 chunks**, 1080p, the same route, the game's own renderer is still ahead —
1929 and 1913 frames a second against 1680 and 1699. The gap is 14%, and it used
to be 34% before the creature pass and the packed vertex; what is left of it is
visible in the same decomposition. Vanilla spends 0.37 ms of its 0.52 ms frame
**waiting for the driver** — it is idle — while this mod spends 0.11. The card
does 0.079 ms of "world and interface" work for vanilla and 0.346 for this mod,
and the terrain itself is 0.05 of that. The rest is the handover, which costs the
same whether there are ten chunks on screen or three thousand.

So the honest statement about short render distances has not changed, and now it
has a mechanism: **this mod pays a fixed toll per frame, and below about
eighteen chunks there is not enough drawing for the toll to be worth paying.**

---

## What is not in the table

- **OptiFine** does not start in a development client at all, so it could not be measured this
  way. It needs a real instance, and that is worth doing separately.
- **Celeritas** is only distributed inside Actinium, and that build stops on a library it
  expects to find bundled with it.
- **Vintagium** and **Neonium** were not measured. Relictium is a fork of Vintagium and stands
  in for that branch.

---

## Caveats

One world, one route, one machine, one build of each, at one render distance. The route is
over open terrain with water and hills, which is a fair average and not a worst case; a dense
modpack is a different question that this does not answer.

The window sizes are windows, not screens: the game was told to render at each size, which is
what decides the cost, and a window larger than the monitor renders every one of its pixels
just the same. Frame rates this high are decided by the processor and the driver as much as by
the card, so the ratios travel better than the absolute numbers do — and the *shapes* of the
rows travel better than either.

The game's own renderer here is this mod with its Vulkan terrain switched off rather than the
game with no mod installed, which is also how it was measured before. Everything here can be
re-run: the harness is in the repository and so is the comparison tool.
